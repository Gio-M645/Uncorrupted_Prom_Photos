Try to do data recovery on the rest on the corrupted drive

People I know in corrupted photos that I was able to partially view:
Fia: 2 - likely more
Atlas/Malerie: 4
Joey: 1
Tyler: 6
Waylon: 2 - likely more
Ben G: unknown
Ben M: unknown
---------------------------------------------------
There may be more so don't forget to recheck these

Note: It's important to preserve these, even if you don't speak to all these people anymore, so don't half-ass this like you usally do with data recovery. Good luck moron, you're gonna need it since you suck so bad at image recovery lol. Also, make sure to offer these to people once they are fixed incase they don't have access to copies and want the memories. It's just polite. Make sure to create a separate folder for each chunk of photos, organizing will be easier.
